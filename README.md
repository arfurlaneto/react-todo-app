# React Todo App

Simple react app developed in a training session with our new interns.

What will be done in the next training session?

- Stylize the error message.
- Stylize task items.
- Done button should be a checkbox, and when checked the item description should be stroked.
- Do now show the clear button when there are no tasks.
